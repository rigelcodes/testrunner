        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This project implemented dialogue tree branches, collision between the player and objects/NPCs, a save and load system, player inventory, the ability to pick up items, minigames, and music for different scenes. Additionally, settings were added so the user could personalize several items such as screen resolution, size, and audio volume.</p>
